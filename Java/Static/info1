## ðŸŒ€ **Order of Execution in Java**

1. **Class Loading**

   * JVM loads the class into memory.
   * Static variables are allocated memory with **default values**.

2. **Class Initialization**

   * Static variables are assigned their **explicit values**.
   * **Static blocks** execute in the order they are written.
   * âœ… This all happens **immediately after class loading**.

3. **Main Method Call**

   * Once static initialization is complete, JVM executes the `main()` method.

## âœ… Final Statement

* **Static members run after class loading, during class initialization, and always before the `main()` method.**
